# quantumdot_fluorescence_sim
Simulation of fluorescence intermittency in quantum dots

To run: 

1) replace the g variables in NPsim.py with the ones from whichever particle (QD, QR, or QP) is being simulated, from whichever of the 3 scenarios being run.

2) In simulation_iterator.py, replace the name of the sample with the name from the particle is being simulated, as found under the g values (e.g. Scenario_x_QD_y).

The simulation, by default, will run 15 iterations of the sim, saving the figure+data for each into a folder.
