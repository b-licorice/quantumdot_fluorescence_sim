# quantumdot_fluorescence_sim
Simulation of fluorescence intermittency in quantum dots

Only the scenario_2.py script needs to be run

Apologies in advance if you decide to actually read the code, I had like 15 minutes both to implement and test the sequential repeater fix (and also eat dinner) so it's the messiest and most rudimentary fix imaginable
